## Abstract
Since the discovery of the cloud-cloud collision in Westerlund 2 in 2009, collisions between interstellar clouds have been observed in more than 50 star forming regions. Not only observations but also magnetohydrodynamic calculations have unveiled the detailed physical processes of such collisions. These findings were summarized in two PASJ special issues in 2018 and 2021 and comprehensively reviewed in a paper by Fukui et al. (2021, PASJ, 73, S1). On the other hand, recent observations of nearby galaxies using ALMA have made it possible to uniformly sample giant molecular clouds across entire galaxies with spatial resolutions of less than 100 pc. This has led to the derivation of fundamental physical parameters of giant molecular clouds, including their lifetimes. Building upon these advances, this symposium aims to discuss topics related to the evolution of giant molecular clouds and high-mass star formation by asking for the submission of a wide range of talks. The final goal of the symposium is to examine the impact of molecular cloud collision phenomena on the evolution of giant molecular clouds, aiming to clarify the role of interstellar cloud collisions in the literature on galactic evolution and the lifecycle of the interstellar medium.
